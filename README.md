# Assignment_GIBots_Pune

## We have trained machine learning model as well as Deep Learning model with this data.

## We got good result with Xgboost ML model. Hence final submission file has predictions from xgboost model.
Predicted Submission file name: xgboost_n_est_200_submission_file.csv

## For EDA on Dataset:
Refer: EDA.ipynb file.

## To Preprocess & Train Model:
